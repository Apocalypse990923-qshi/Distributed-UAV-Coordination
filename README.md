# Distributed-UAV-Coordination
EE597 Lab2\
In this project, we are tackling distributed uav coordination. The goal is to find a reliable method
of communication among a group of uav nodes using User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The
purpose is to establish an agreement protocol among the uav nodes for each to match to a
unique target once the target is within range.
